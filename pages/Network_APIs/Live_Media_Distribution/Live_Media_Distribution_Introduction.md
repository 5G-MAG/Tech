# Introduction: Live Media Distribution

Consumption of TV and radio content over the internet is increasing. For content providers and users the internet is becoming their primary way of distribution or consumption, when not the only option they use.

Content providers are therefore increasingly interested in understanding how (well) their content is being delivered over the internet, particularly where content is delivered "over the top" (OTT), with no guaranteed quality of experience (QoE) - despite content providers making content available with different quality of service (QoS) levels.

Network operators may not be aware of, or be able to find out how well individual services from the many content and service providers are being delivered over their network as they typically do not have sight of the entire distribution chain, right the way from source to client app. On the other hand, while content providers typically have sight of both the source and the app, they do not have visibility of the networks in between.

Being able to log relevant performance data through the client application and share it with the network operator raises the prospect of content providers and network operators working together in order to obtain a more complete picture of performance over the entire distribution chain with the aim of improving content delivery and consumers’ experience. Standards-based ways of doing this may be beneficial.
