# Network Capability Exposure and APIs for Live Media Distribution

## Scenario description and actors involved

<img src="./images/figure_high_level_diagram.png" width="60%">

The actors involved are:

Today, audio streaming services would have to be delivered over-the-top, i.e. without any defined quality of service (QoS). Measurements of such a service over today's mobile networks indicate that the QoS experienced by listeners may fall short of their expectations (e.g. interruption-free playback delivered with a delay comparable with linear broadcast radio/television).
