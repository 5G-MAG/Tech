# Network Capabilities (Network Services) for Content Production & Contribution

## Quality of Service
- Ability to identify media/data flows coming from devices (identify of flow? application? SIM? Device?): delivery to endpoint (Application Media Server) identified by security/protocol/IP/port
- Ability to configure new or pre-select QoS profiles
- Ability to request attaching a QoS profile to a media/data flow
- Ability to receive ACK (success/fail)
- Ability to reconfigure QoS profile for a given flow

## Real-time information monitoring and/ Network assistance
- Ability to receive real-time information able to influence uplink media delivery details (e.g. codec reconfiguration, bitrate reconfiguration)
- Ability to receive notification/monitor network quality
- Ability to receive notification on unavailable capability

## Time Synchronization
-	Ability to enable distribution of timing information

## Logging
-	Ability to receive a report of an uplink media delivery session
