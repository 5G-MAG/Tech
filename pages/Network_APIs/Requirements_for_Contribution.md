# Network Capabilities (Network Services) for Content Production & Contribution

## Quality of Service
- Ability to apply different QoS profiles to individual data flows coming from the same device.
- Ability to separate media/data flows coming from devices
  - Delivery to endpoint (Application Media Server) may be identified by security/protocol/IP/port
- Ability to configure new or re-configure existing QoS profiles to be selected during runtime 
- Ability to select at runtime a QoS profile for a media flow
- Ability to receive ACK (success/fail)

## Information monitoring, logging and/or Network assistance
- Ability to receive information from the network
  - real-time for QoS profile re-selection and/or e.g. codec reconfiguration, bitrate reconfiguration
  - during runtime for troubleshooting 
  - after the session (logging information) for post-processing

## Time Synchronization
-	Ability to enable distribution of timing information
