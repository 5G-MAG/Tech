##  Content Production and Contribution Scenarios

Wireless connectivity is a key element in content production and contribution, including productions in studios, coverage of live events in venues or on-the-move, commentary boxes, newsgathering,... These different setups may have unique needs involving specific infrastructure and equipment, as well as distinct media connectivity flows with varying quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To enhance the standard best-effort connectivity, Network APIs can be used to access advanced network capabilities. The following analysis includes a brief description of scenarios where advanced network capabilities can be invoked, example operational workflows and a series of requirements (including network capabilities) in the context of content production and contribution.

* Workflows: [Required interactions to exploit network capabilities](./Network_APIs/Content_Production/Production_Contribution_Workflows.html).
* Requirements: [Network Capabilities (Network Services) for Content Production & Contribution](./Network_APIs/Content_Production/Production_Contribution_Requirements.html).
